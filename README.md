# Analytical study of the performance of potential Drug Regimens
Pymaceuticals Inc., specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. Recently, they conduct an animal study to find the potential effect of certain drug regimens for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), In this study, 249 mice identified and treated over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The main purpose this study was to identify the drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other drug regimens.  This is a study to prepare top-level summary of the treatment regimen study results.
In the beginning the data is cleaned by droping duplicate entries of Mouse ID with timepoint.  Then, aggregation methods were used for the statistical study of the tumor volume for each drug regimen. Different plotting methods were used to analyse the study results.  Calculated the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determined whether any potential outliers across Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin treatment regimens. Then, generated box and whisker plots of final tumor volume.  Calculated the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment over scatter plot. 
Finally, the story observed from the analytical study is included in the top of this notebook.
